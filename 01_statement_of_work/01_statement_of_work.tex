\section{Introduction}
As part of engineering degree at Charles Darwin University students require to undertake integrated design group project. An integrated group design project requires students to work together to complete the design task set by a client. The design project must meet client’s specification and performance criteria; it must be completed within the time frame; and satisfy all of the required milestones.\\

For electrical engineering students the design task is to build an autonomous robotic vehicle. The realisation of the project involves making a mathematical model, system simulation, designing control loops, completing the design of the vehicle mechanically and electrically and implementing the designed system using National Instruments MyRio hardware and LabVIEW software. 
%------------------------------------------------------
\section{Requirements \& Scope}
The main requirement of this project is to design and build an autonomous robotic vehicle that will traverse an enclosed area, which consists of obstacles. The robot will start from a randomised location, and needs to navigate to a designated finish position, in the shortest possible time. The finish location will be highlighted by a red marker, and once the robot has reached its objective, it must stop and provide a signal, physical or otherwise. These requirements can be found in more detail in the requirements matrix shown in Table 1.\\

\section{Design Options}
There are a number of competing designs which would serve the project's intended objectives, and still fall within the purview of the scope. Broadly, in terms of complexity, these solutions can be placed into one of three categories: low, moderate, or high. Typically, the higher the complexity the greater the cost of the project, however, with increased complexity there is an expectation of greater performance and efficiency. This section of the report provides a high level overview for each of the three options, making elementary design recommendations for each. The section concludes by nominating a preferred solution, and proposing future lines of enquiry which need to be directed to the client.

\subsection{Low Design Complexity}
One of the simplest and lowest cost designs, would be the implementation of a finite state machine. The robot chassis would be equipped with four sensors: one IR sensor on the front to check for an obstacle free path forward, and two on the sides of the robot to provide assurance the robot will not collide with walls to the left and right. A final sensor could be employed on rear of the robot chassis, pointing towards the floor, which would be used to detect if the robot is currently placed on the red exit panel. Kumar et alias (2016) suggest two types of IR sensor for this implementation: a SHARP GP2D120 (4cm to 30cm range) for the sides of the robot, and a SHARP GP2Y0A21YK0F (10cm to 80cm range) for the front of the robot. A very simple example of what the robot’s operation might look like can be seen in Figure 3 - this robot has 4 states of operation in which it can operate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Forward:} the robot operates in this mode of operation provided there are no obstacles present in the robot’s path (within some certain distance threshold). The robot will maintain a constant forward velocity in this mode - perhaps implemented with PID control. If the robot’s sensor detects an obstacle in the path, then the robot would transition to the stop state. Finally, if the robot detects that it is on the red ‘exit’ panel, then the robot would move to the finish state.
\item \textbf{Stop:} in the stop state the robot would set the velocity to zero, and checking the encoder that this was true. This state would persist if the robot was not stopped. If the robot was stopped, and the path was blocked, then the robot would transition to the turn state. If the robot was stopped, and the path was not blocked, then the robot would transition back to the forward state.
\item \textbf{Turn:} in the turn state, the robot would move the left motor forward, and the right motor in reverse, to perform a 90 degree pivot turn (a turn on the spot). Once the robot has complete the 90 degree turn, the robot will automatically transition state back to the stop state.
\item \textbf{Finish:} if the robot transitions to this state, then the robot is current located over the red exit panel for the environment. The robot will signal (audio or otherwise) that it is exiting the environment. The robot cannot transition out of this state - it is persistent.
\end{enumerate}

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Whilst simple to implement, this design poses high risk of failure, and would need careful consideration of scenarios which may cause this failure. One elementary example of how this system might fail can be seen in Figure 4. Significant modifications to the scheme, and subsequent simulation or experimentation would need to be undertaken to ensure the required outcomes are met if this design is selected. A full description of the design option advantages, disadvantages, and hardware requirements can be found in Table XXXX.

\subsection{Moderate Design Complexity}
The principal advancement of this design is underpinned by more sophisticated software used to traverse an environment topology. A similar IR sensor layout to the robot in Section 4.1 would be used, however, Kapoor et alias (2017) recommend an ultrasonic sensor on the front of the robot to provide longer mapping capability for more effective paths. Since environment dimensions are known, the map could be discretised into robot sized segments, as shown in Figure 5. The software would capitalise on this structure by creating a 3-dimensional \verb|char| array to map progress. The array would be 4 times the size of the discretised map since the starting location is randomised, and depth would be 6 elements, whose contents are described in Table 1. Mapping the environment in this way would allow more intelligent options for navigating the terrain, allowing the robot to document visited areas, and regions of the environment with obstacles.

This scheme would provide higher levels of assurance that the robot will traverse the full map and arrive at the exit panel, however, this implementation runs the risk of exceeding the 3 minute time limit - it is easy to imagine a scenario in which the exit is located in the final panel visited.

\subsection{High Design Complexity}
The previous two design options are best suited to basic environments, like the one shown in Figure 7. This environment has obstacles with surfaces that are orthogonal or parallel to other obstacle surfaces. The design options shown in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 may start to encounter difficulties when presented environments that are more complex, like that shown in Figure 7.

\caption{An example of a more complex environment which has obstacle surfaces at angles, providing more opportunities for simple system failure.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

This is because obstacles may fall across multiple grid regions, or simply because the variability of obstacle angles create more permutations of environments in which a simple robot may get trapped. This would increase the difficulty involved with ensuring that each of these unique 'trapping' environments are considered. A more robust solution for dealing with complex environments, would be to use more sophisticated sensors to map the environment with higher fidelity.

\caption{Using a simple RGB (or HSV) segmentation filter, the navigable terrain is highlighted to use for obstacle avoidance}
\end{figure}

There are a number of different options when looking at more sophisticated sensors. Some of these include optical (RGB) cameras, optical with IR depth (RGBD) cameras, or Lidar. The later two sensors provide advanced options like developing point clouds of an environment, but are considerably more costly. An example showing a simple RGB camera mounted to the front of the robot can be seen in Figure 8. The image from the robot camera is transformed to aid conceptualisation of the environment map - this step is purely aesthetic. Figure 9 shows the segmentation of navigable terrain and obstacles using a HSV filter. Advanced sensors provide rich environmental information sets, which allow for more sophisticated mapping and navigation algorithms. According to Cadena, et alias (2016), simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) is widely employed in autonomous robotics. SLAM allows simultaneous estimation of robot state ($x$-coord, $y$-coord, $z$-coord, roll, pitch, yaw), and mapping of the environment. Much less sophisticated techniques, such as using odometry for mapping, tend to accumulate error over time. SLAM provides a 'reset' of these errors by revisiting previously mapped areas. This approach allows robust accurate mapping, and efficient location of the exit zone, meaning the robot can reach it's objective faster.

From the Figure above it can be seen that the longest phases of the project are 2 and 3. These phases comprise the most challenging elements and two major milestones of the project i.e. completion of the robotic vehicle electrically and mechanically, development of working algorithm, design calculations, testing and troubleshooting and finally completing technical report.

\section{Project Stakeholders}
The identification of the project stakeholders is a primary task of any project. Project stakeholders are those groups/individuals that design and execute the project; change project direction if necessary; and last but not least  decide on the outcome of the project thus it's imperative to acknowledge all the stakeholders of the project.\\

The stakeholders of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Client} - Erwin Chan, Rob Wolff, Charlie
\item \textbf{Design team} - Shane Reynolds, Sakon Nadthayai, Tatyana Maltseva  
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------
\section{Budget Estimates}
Each of the three design options require the use of the Rover 5 chassis, the 4 channel motor controller, and the NI myRio Xilinx processor. The main differentiation in terms of cost comes down to the sensors that will be employed and the estimated man hours involved with the implementation. Table 7 provides the estimated budget for each option.

\section{Project Constraints}
The project has 3 limitations that can be considered as constraints including;
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cost}: for achieving of design the robot performing effectively as a client requirement, it requires to use a high quality of camera for example, a RGBD camera and a number of sensors to increase a performance of the robot to move and check obstacles faster and more accurate. Therefore,it can affect an increasing of budgeting.
\item \textbf{Time}: because of a short time period of the completed project which is only 11 weeks the project has to completely finish building a perfect robot that can work perfectly as the client requirement, during a process of designing to implementing the autonomous robotic vehicle , it requires time to test, evaluate, study,search and improve to make the robot working perfectly. Thus, as the limitation of time may affect the quality of the robot performance. Also a delivery time of ordered any material parts might affect the time frame.
\item \textbf{Scope}: as the limitation of the project scope and the client requirement affect cost,time frame and quality in the project, if one factor is changed this will affect to other factor. However, this project is focusing on the quality of the robotic performance  therefore the cost and the time are required more.
Quality; because of the limitation of the budget and the time frame in this project it affects to the quality of the robotic performance. As an extend of the budgeting and time frame will make high quality of the autonomous robotic vehicle performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preferred Design \& Points for Discussion}
The preferred design option is one which meets the project requirements an operates within the project constraints, whilst delivering an optimal outcome for performance and cost. In reality, the best solution is most likely to include elements from the low, moderate, and high complexity design options - there are useful design elements in each. The most robust solution would be the

\midrule
What materials is the environment constructed with? & Will the location of the exit zone always be in the same sport? Or will the location be random?\\
Does the environment change, or will it be the same topology? & Will the location of the exit have any defining characteristics (e.g. located next to a wall) \\
Is there access to a test environment? & Is the project restricted to using NI myRio hardware?\\
Does the entrance to the environment always start at the same point, or is it randomised? & \\
Will the walls and obstacles be assigned with parallel, and orthogonal surfaces? & \\
Will the environment be based on a grid? Or will the environment be random? & \\
