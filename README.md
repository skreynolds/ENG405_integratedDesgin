# ENG720 Integrated Design

Integrated Design is an engineering capstone project which brings together much of the previous learning in the engineering course. The main features of Integrated Design are:

* An integrated group design project, covering several aspects of engineering

* Detailed application of knowledge from previous units in the engineering course - the project ensures parts of as many previous units as possible are incorporated

* Full application of life cycle analysis and the principle of Concept, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO)

* Taking a design brief to a functional (to client's expectations) outcome

## Unit Learning Outcomes
1. Design an integrated complex project through the use of the design cycle.
2. Liaise and negotiate with clients to produce a completed item that meets all of the clients' expectations.
3. Critically evaluate and employ standards and systematic design procedures.
4. Meet relevant safety requirements and standards in the design of an integrated project.
5. Identify, select and apply components of prior learning in engineering relevant to the successful completion of complex design projects.
6. Evaluate a complex integrated project against a lifecycle analysis and the principles of CDIO.
7. Demonstrate effective written communication to convey ideas, principles and technical information relating to design projects, to a level appropriate for professional presentation to clients and other external stakeholders.
